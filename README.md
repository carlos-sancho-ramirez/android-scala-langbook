# android-scala-langbook

Langbook is intended to be a tool to help people in their task of learning new
languages and master the ones they may already know. A database is used to store
words for the different languages and link them with concepts in a sensible way
that may bring basic semantic.

This repository contains all Android platform dependent sources.

See also [generic-scala-langbook](https://github.com/carlos-sancho-ramirez/generic-scala-langbook)
for the Langbook platform independent code.
